    "- Small prompt changes cause dramatic behavior shifts and different tool calls \n",

    "## 📚 Section 5: User Simulation (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "While **traditional evaluation methods rely on fixed test cases**, real-world conversations are dynamic and unpredictable. This is where User Simulation comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "User Simulation is a powerful feature in ADK that addresses the limitations of static evaluation. Instead of using pre-defined, fixed user prompts, User Simulation employs a generative AI model (like Gemini) to **dynamically generate user prompts during the evaluation process.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❓ How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "* You define a `ConversationScenario` that outlines the user's overall conversational goals and a `conversation_plan` to guide the dialogue.\n",
    "* A large language model (LLM) then acts as a simulated user, using this plan and the ongoing conversation history to generate realistic and varied prompts.\n",
    "* This allows for more comprehensive testing of your agent's ability to handle unexpected turns, maintain context, and achieve complex goals in a more natural, unpredictable conversational flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "User Simulation helps you uncover edge cases and improve your agent's robustness in ways that static test cases often miss.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 👉 Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you understand the power of User Simulation for dynamic agent evaluation, here's an exercise to apply it:\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply the **User Simulation** feature to your agent. Define a `ConversationScenario` with a `conversation_plan` for a specific goal, and integrate it into your agent's evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**⭐ Refer to this [documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/evaluate/user-sim/) to learn how to do it.**"
