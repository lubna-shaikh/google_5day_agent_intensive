# 📘 Google 5-Day Agentic AI Intensive - My Implementations

This repository contains my personal implementations of the **Google 5-Day Agentic AI Intensive Course**, offered on Kaggle.

The base repository is the official course material, but **all code inside**:

- `my-labs/`
- `my-notes/`
- `my-tools/`
- `my-diagrams/`
- `my-screenshots/`

is **100% my own work**.

# 🧠 What I Built

Across 5 days, I implemented:

## ✔ Day 1 - From Prompts to Agents
- Basic agent execution loop  
- Multi-step reasoning  
- First autonomous workflow  

## ✔ Day 2 - Tools and Multi-Agent Architectures
- Custom tools (search, extract, summarize, classify)  
- Multi-agent orchestration patterns  
- Task delegation  

## ✔ Day 3 - Safety, Guardrails, and Error Handling
- Safety checks  
- Self-evaluation loops  
- Recovery mechanisms  

## ✔ Day 4 - Retrieval-Augmented Agents (RAG)
- Vector search  
- Context grounding  
- Knowledge-based assistants  

## ✔ Day 5 - Real-World AI Agents
- End-to-end multi-agent workflow  
- Production-style design decisions  
- Scalability considerations

# 📄 My Learning Diary

Each day includes reflections explaining:

- What I learned  
- What went wrong  
- How I debugged  
- How I improved the agent  
- Why certain design choices were made  

This shows my **reasoning process**, not just code.
